abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a very promising diagnostic method in clinical practice, especially for ophthalmic diseases. However, speckle noise and low sampling rates have intensively reduced the quality of OCT images, which prevents the development of OCT-assisted diagnosis. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network-based approach (named SDSR-OCT) to simultaneously denoise and super-resolve OCT images. Moreover, we trained three different super-resolution models with different upscale factors (2x , 4x and 8x ) to adapt to the corresponding downsampling rates. We also quantitatively and qualitatively compared our proposed method with some well-known algorithms. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively suppress speckle noise and can super-resolve OCT images at different scales.
